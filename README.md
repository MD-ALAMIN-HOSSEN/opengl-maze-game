# Game Features:
1.	Player Movement:
    •	The player navigates through the maze using the arrow keys for movement and the space bar to jump. The controls are smooth and responsive, allowing precise maneuvering through tight spaces and around obstacles. The ability to jump adds a layer of complexity, enabling the player to avoid certain obstacles or enemies and reach higher platforms.
2.	Player Animation:
    •	The player character is animated, providing visual feedback for different actions such as walking, running, and jumping. These animations enhance the immersive experience by making the character's movements appear more realistic and engaging.
3.	Enemies:
    •	The maze is populated with enemies that patrol specific paths or move randomly. These enemies pose a threat to the player and contact with them results in the loss of a life. The player must navigate the maze carefully to avoid or outrun these enemies.
4.	Obstacles:
    •	Various obstacles are strategically placed throughout the maze to impede the player's progress. These obstacles require the player to think critically and plan their movements to find a clear path to the goal.
5.	Coin Collection:
    •	Scattered throughout the maze are coins that the player can collect. Collecting coins increases the player's score. Active coins are visually distinct and can be collected by moving over them. While there is only one level in the game, collecting coins adds an extra challenge and boosts the player's score, providing an additional goal beyond simply reaching the end of the maze.
6.	Goal:
    •	The ultimate objective of the game is to reach the goal, which is located at a specific point within the maze. Reaching the goal signifies the completion of the level.
7.	Teleporter:
    •	The maze features teleporters that allow the player to instantly move from one point to another within the maze. These teleporters are essential for navigating complex areas and avoiding enemies. Using teleporters effectively is key to mastering the maze.
8.	Lives and Health:
    •	The player starts with two lives. Contact with enemies or certain obstacles results in the loss of a life. Within the maze, there are health packs or hearts that the player can collect to gain additional lives, up to a maximum of three. Maintaining lives is crucial for surviving the maze and reaching the goal.
9.	Score and Life Board:
    •	The game features a score and life board displayed on the screen. This board shows the current score based on the coins collected and the number of lives remaining. It provides real-time feedback to the player, helping them keep track of their progress and remaining chances.
10.	Collision Detection:
    •	Collision detection is implemented to ensure the player interacts correctly with enemies, obstacles, coins, and teleporters. The game continuously checks for collisions, updating the player's status and score accordingly. Proper collision handling is crucial for providing a fair and predictable gaming experience.
